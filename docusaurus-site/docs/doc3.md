title: What's the Current Situation?
---

Globally, as of 4:17pm CEST, 4 June 2020, there have been 6,416,828 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 382,867 deaths reported.

For an overview of the COVID-19 situation in different countries, there are multiple interactive visualizations available. These are provided by [**Johns Hopkins University**](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and [**Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation**](https://healthmap.org/covid-19/). The [**dataset**](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) used by Johns Hopkins University is treated as one of the canonical sources of data. 

While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. 

However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon research results become available.
