title: How Can I Help?
---

One simple way to contribute is to donate computing power to COVID-19 projects. For example, [**Folding@home**](https://foldingathome.org/) is a distributed-computing project that uses the personal computers of volunteers to model computational drug design. They have started an effort focused on COVID-19 to find potentially druggable protein targets, and you can contribute by [**helping them run simulations**](https://foldingathome.org/covid19/).

If you are interested in programming, you can support [**COVID-19 related open-source projects on GitHub**](https://github.blog/2020-03-23-open-collaboration-on-covid-19/)

You can also contribute to this website by sharing credible articles or [**improving existing articles**](add2.md) on the Articles tab. If you are interested in data analytics, you can also [**share your data visualization**](add1.md) on Dashboard tab. With your contributions, we can combat misinformation about COVID-19 together.
