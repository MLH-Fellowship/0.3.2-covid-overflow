title: When Will The Pandemic End?
---

While no one knows for sure when the pandemic will end, there are numerous projects which simulate the spread of COVID depending on user-defined parameters. This information can be used to estimate the expected number of cases in different regions over time.

[**Predict COVID-19**](https://predictcovid.com/) allows users to compare the number of COVID-19 cases between different countries, which gives an idea of how the epidemic might progress in the coming days.

[**COVID-19 Scenarios**](https://covid19-scenarios.org/) is an outbreak simulator for COVID-19, which aims to determine strain on the health care systems in various regions as the outbreak unfolds.

[**Modelling COVID-19**](https://modelingcovid.com/) models how COVID-19 might spread through a population for different locations and different social distancing scenarios.
