title: How do I Stay Safe?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  

These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.

**Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene** is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.

When possible, maintain at least a **1 meter distance** between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating. 

WHO recommends wearing **medical masks** for personnel in health care settings and for people who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.

In addition, contact tracing applications can notify users if they have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient. Wikipedia maintains a [**list of contact tracing applications**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_apps) for various regions and their links.
